# A3 - Nth Prime Number

You are to complete the given function:

```python
def nthPrime(n):
    """ nthPrime determines the nth prime number.

    -- param
    n : int

    -- return
    integer
    """

```

nthPrime finds the prime number at the n location of the prime number series.

**You may assume that:**

- The first (1st : n = 1) prime is 2
- The second (2nd: n = 2) prime is 3

Your nthPrime function will return the prime number at that location.
